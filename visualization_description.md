### The COVID-19 visualization/dashboard

The visualization was created as a python program in the jupyter notebook format. Running the entire notebook visualizes the data stored in Cassandra by drawing clusters on a map of Stockholm. The notebook does the following: 

* Fetch data from Cassandra, and save it to an array where each item is a tuple of grid index and count for said index.
* Calculate the sizes of the clusters to be drawn. 
  * This is done by making the size of each cluster proportional to the percentage of total covid tweets that are in that specific area. 
* Draw the clusters on the map of Stockholm. 

The idea is that this dashboard could be used by Folkh√§lsomyndigheten to determine which areas of the city  require action to reduce the spread of the virus.
